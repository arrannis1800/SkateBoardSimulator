### Interview Task

---

Before you begin, ensure that the prototype is designed in 3D. Both the executable and Unreal Engine project should be available on GitHub for review.

- Create a functional Skateboarding Simulator Game, it should feature full control of the character skateboarding, as well as the speed-up, slow-down and jump functions, it should allow us to move around a small designed park, or street side.
- Required features:
    1. Movement Functionality 
    2. Small Designed Level with Jumping obstacles
    3. Jumping- *Utilize any Jump animation from Mixamo using Animation Blueprint to make it appear as if it was a regular Jump with skate, using the Blend Modes in Animation Blueprint*
    4. Pushing Functionality *- Speed up*
    5. Slow Down Functionality
    6. Points system - *for every obstacle jumped over* 
- Design a suitable UI for the prototype
- Utilize either pre-made assets or create your own for this task
- If using pre-written code, or re-used blueprints from other projects, clearly specify the sections implemented during the interview, as we want to understand what was created during the interview period.
